# USB Optical Drives

While the PS2's built-in DVD-ROM drive is available for use within PS2 Linux, the drive itself is locked down to only allow reading of Playstation 2 formatted CDs and DVDs. Reading discs of other types is strictly forbidden. Using USB CD-ROM/DVD-ROM Optical Drives with PS2 Linux provides functionality for reading CDs and DVDs of all formats. If USB CD-RW/DVD-RW drives are used, this also provides an avenue for burning CDs and DVDs from PS2 Linux.
